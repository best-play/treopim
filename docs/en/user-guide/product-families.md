# Product Families

**Product Family** â€“ a grouping of similar [products](https://treopim.com/help/products), which use similar or same production processes, have similar physical characteristics, and may share customer segments, distribution channels, pricing methods, promotional campaigns, and other elements of the marketing mix. 

In TreoPIM product families are used in order to define a set of [attributes](https://treopim.com/help/attributes) that are shared by products belonging to a certain family, and to describe the characteristics of these products. For each product family you can define, which attributes are mandatory and which are optional, so the system can calculate the completeness of your product content.

*Please, note that completeness calculation is possible only when a separate **"Completeness"** module is installed in your system. Please, visit our [store](https://treopim.com/store/completeness) to learn more about the module and its features.*

Creating a product family is a required step prior to arranging the assortment of your products. The product can belong only to one product family.

One attribute can be used in several product families and product family can have many attributes assigned. Each product can be assigned to only one product family.

Product families can be seen as "templates" for creating products with certain attributes quickly. When creating a new product, a product family is to be chosen and thus, all the attributes to describe this certain product will be automatically linked to the product so the user should decide to fill them or not.

The attributes linked to the product via the product family can be unlinked from the product only if the product is unlinked from the family or this attribute is removed from the product family directly.

Product families can be activated or deactivated. 

## Product Family Fields

The product family entity comes with the following preconfigured fields; mandatory are marked with *:

| **Field Name**           | **Description**                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Active                   | Activity state of the product family record         |

| Code *                   | Unique value used to identify the product family. It can only consist of lowercase letters, digits and underscore symbols     |
| Description (multi-lang) | Description of the product family usage                   |
