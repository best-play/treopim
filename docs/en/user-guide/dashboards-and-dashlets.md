# Dashboards and Dashlets

Dashboards are designed for quick navigation within the TreoPIM entities data displayed on separate dashlets. The dashboard is the starting page of TreoPIM that can be reached any time via clicking the `TreoPIM` logo located in the upper left corner of TreoPIM page:

Both dashboards and dashlets are [user customizable](https://treopim.com/help/user-interface), i.e. you can add, rename and delete dashboards, as well as modify the dashlets layout.

## Dashboards

The `My TreoCore` dashboard comes out-of-the-box and is displayed on the TreoPIM starting page by default. It can be customized by adding the desired [dashlets](#dashlets) and configuring them. 

### Creating a Dashboard

It is also possible to create custom boards. To do this, click the pencil icon on the TreoPIM starting page and enter the desired dashboard name in the editing pop-up that appears and hit `Enter`:

Click the `Save` button to complete the operation or `Cancel` to abort the process.

Please, note that in the given editing pop-up you can create as many dashboards as needed, but their customization is performed separately for each dashboard. 

Creating new dashboards is useful if you wish to group a different set of dashlets, consisting of certain information of the same nature or type, to help you make the right decision.

## Dashlets

Dashlets are [user-configurable](https://treopim.com/help/user-interface) blocks, which can be placed via drag-and-drop anywhere on the dashboard, giving you a quick overview of your records and activity. 

Dashlets provide you with valuable information regarding records of specific entities.
