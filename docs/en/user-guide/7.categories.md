# Categories

**Category** – a way to organize your products within a certain channel by the type of products you sell. For instance, if you are selling electronics, your categories might be computers, televisions, projectors, speakers, cell phones, etc. Each category can have only one *parent category*. Categories are a powerful tool and can be used not only to sort your content, but also to develop a proper structure of your product catalog that is meaningful and semantic. Categories have a hierarchical taxonomy, meaning that each category can have child categories. 

**Parent Category** – is the category to which the category is assigned to. If "Berlin" is a category, "Germany" may be its parent category.

**Subcategores** – are all child-categories, assigned to a certain category. Subcategories for the Category "Germany" may be "Berlin", "Munich" and "Dusseldorf".

**Category tree** – is the aggregate of all categories and parent-child relations among them. Category tree starts from a category, which has no parent category (also called Root Category) and ends on many branches by categories without subcategories (child-categories). 

There can be many category trees in TreoPIM. Each Category can have only one parent category. Each Category may have many subcategories. One Category can be used in several category trees. 

A whole category tree or its part, starting from any category can be assigned to some channel, to define, which products should be transferred within this channel. Many products can be assigned to a category and each product my be assigned to more than one category.

Categories can be activated or deactivated. Deactivated categories cannot be used in the system and are not transferred via any channel, like the products added to that category.

## One Category Tree vs Multiple Category Trees

Each adopter of TreoPIM may decide for himself, what is better for him, to set up and support multiple category trees or just one, it is still possible to synchronize different content and different prices to different channels you wand to supply. 

### Product Categories in different Languages

Even if you want to manage your product content in different languages you don't need to maintain multiple category tree. There are two ways, how you can set up your product catalog, if you care of product information in different languages:

1. Create separate category tree for each language / locate
2. Create a single category tree using multi-language field type for the category name.
  The first approach is better, if you want to provide different channels with different product catalog, eg some product should be transferred to channel 1, but not to channel 2. The second one is better if your want to deliver the product information about all your products to all channels.
